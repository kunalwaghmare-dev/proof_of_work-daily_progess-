today i learned about the concept i.e node.js module


#notes:
*Node.js modules allow us to split our code into small, reusable components,
*we can import module into another one by using require() ,
*module makes the code more clan , organized and easy to maintain.

* there are different types of modules 
1) built in modules like fs, http etc.
2) user defined module (created by user)
3) external modules (created with 'init' command)
